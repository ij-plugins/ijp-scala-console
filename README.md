ijp-scala-console
=================

Simple user interface for executing Scala scripts. Can be run stand-alone or embedded in a desktop application.

Currently, it is primarily developed to be run as an [ImageJ](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) plugin. It can also run as a stand-alone application, see [ScalaConsoleApp](scala-console/src/main/scala/net/sf/ij_plugins/scala/console/ScalaConsoleApp.scala)
